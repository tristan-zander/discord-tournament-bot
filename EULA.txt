**General Terms**
In order to operate optimally, services running under the "Runback" organization will receive and store certain identifying user information and messages gathered through the Discord client. The usage of these services means that you consent to have *any* data within your Discord server to be accessible and stored long term by the bot. 

**Discord Client**
The Discord client will store information about a user's Discord account, such as Discord ID and email address. The client may also temporarily store messages sent in a server, such as during tournaments and matchmaking sessions, for up to thirty (30) days. Users that do not interact with the bot will not have their information stored by "Runback" services.

**Privacy Policy**
The "Runback" platform will take all reasonable precautions to ensure that identifying information is kept within the platform and only accessible by authorized users. Trusted members that operate under the "Runback" organization will have visible access to all non-secret information for testing, development, and monitoring purposes. Secret information refers to passwords, payment information, and other forms of private data. Secrets will always be encrypted and only visible to the user that owns the secret and any service that they explicitly grant authorization to secrets.
Any user may request that any of their identifying information be expunged from the platform at any time, leaving only their unique user ID in the database. Non-identifying information, such as matchmaking history or ranking points, will still reference your unique user ID. No information will ever be shared outside of the "Runback" platform or any integration without the consent of the user.

***By using this service, you agree to the terms of this End User License Agreement.***
